		Simran, a young Indian woman living in London, dreams of love and adventure. Her conservative father, however, has arranged her marriage to his friend's son in India. Before the wedding, Simran is allowed a month-long European trip with her friends.

On the trip, she meets Raj, a fun-loving, carefree guy. Initially, they clash, but eventually, they fall in love. When Simran returns to London, her father finds out about the romance and takes the family to India to marry her off as planned.

Raj follows Simran to India, determined to win over her family instead of eloping with her. Through charm and persistence, he gains the trust of her relatives and finally earns the respect of her strict father, who lets Simran choose her own happiness.
